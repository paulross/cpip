Welcome to CPIP
======================

CPIP is a C/C++ pre-processor implemented in Python. Instead of regard pre-processing as a dirty job that just has to be done as quickly as possible CPIP records every detail of preprocessing for inspection.

Have a look at CPIP's pre-processing visulisation of the `Linux Kernel file: cpu.c <copy_to_html/cpu/index_cpu.c_9421877faaf4151b78debf7c842685f2.html>`_.
