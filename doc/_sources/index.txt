Welcome to CPIP
======================

CPIP is a C/C++ pre-processor implemented in Python.

Instead of regard pre-processing as a just a dirty job that just has to be done as quickly as possible CPIP records every detail of preprocessing for inspection. Uniquely, CPIP can make those difficult preprocessing debugging problems easy to solve.

CPIP can can produce some wonderfully visual information about file dependencies, macro usage and much more (see :ref:`cpip-examples`).

CPIP's project page is here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/cpip/
